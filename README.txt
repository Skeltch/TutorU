This project connects to our digital ocean droplet at the ip TutorU.mooo.com.
Source code for the apk can be found in TutorU/app/src/main.
From there java is for the application and res is for the xml files.
The server files can be found at https://github.com/Skeltch/Server.
This app was originally for a Software Engineering class and thus resulted in an initially rushed project.
I am now going through and updating past features and finishing the core aspect of this app.
